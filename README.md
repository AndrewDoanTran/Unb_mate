**Test case**
+ Reminder assignment input order for date: D-M-Y: For example, 02-12-2025
+ Reminder assignment input order for time: 14:20
+ For the name buildings syntax: student union, library, keirstead, security, toole, forestry, maclagan.
+ Our Add to Reminder work properly, and the reminder will be added to scroll view.
+ View schedule will display all assignments by scroll view and auto delete pass due assignments.
+ Delete Reminder also work properly, the user should input exactly name of assignment, due date, due time, and class. This is our inconvenience if the user can not remember exactly 4 inputs.
+ For the direction: the user will put the name buildings from the list above to the text field, then program will show the path for user on the map.
+ Our microphone button does not complete yet. 
+ The last one is when user turn off the phone, or close the app. When they are comeback, the app still stores the name and student id (local storage).
